# Pokédex JavaScript App

This project is a small web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web application. As part of this project, I aim to learn about programming by completing a project using JavaScript and related technologies. Since I haven’t yet learned how to build my own API, I'll be relying on an external data source for this project.

## Features and Requirements

### User Goals
I should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand. In this case, I'll build a simple Pokédex app to display a list of Pokémon.

### Key Features
Load data from an external source (API)
View a list of items
On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item
### Technical Requirements
Required:

The app must load data from an external API, such as the Pokémon API.
Display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
Enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
Have CSS styling.
Format JavaScript code according to ESLint rules.
Use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or touch interactions.
Not throw any errors when being used.
Be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages.
Work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

Nice to Have:

Show loading indicators while loading data.
Handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly error messages.
## Mock-ups or Other Assets

Mock-ups for a simple Pokédex app are provided for reference purposes. Note that the app may look different depending on the type of data you’re displaying. Feel free to get creative and use a different layout for your data if desired.
