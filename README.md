# Pokédex JavaScript App

This project is a small web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web application. As part of this project, I aim to learn about programming by completing a project using JavaScript and related technologies. Since I haven’t yet learned how to build my own API, I'll be relying on an external data source for this project.

## Features and Requirements

### User Goals
I should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand. In this case, I'll build a simple Pokédex app to display a list of Pokémon.

### Key Features
Load data from an external source (API)
View a list of items
On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item
### Technical Requirements
Required:

The app must load data from an external API, such as the Pokémon API.
Display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
Enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
Have CSS styling.
Format JavaScript code according to ESLint rules.
Use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or touch interactions.
Not throw any errors when being used.
Be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages.
Work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

Nice to Have:

Show loading indicators while loading data.
Handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly error messages.
## Mock-ups or Other Assets

Mock-ups for a simple Pokédex app are provided for reference purposes. Note that the app may look different depending on the type of data you’re displaying. Feel free to get creative and use a different layout for your data if desired.

## Project Deliverables

Throughout this Achievement, I’ll be working from Exercise to Exercise to complete my Achievement project. For each task, I’ll submit a deliverable that directly contributes to the final product—in this case, my JavaScript app.

## Exercises Overview

This project consists of multiple exercises, each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript programming, DOM interaction, APIs, complex UI elements, and more. Here's an overview of the exercises involved:

- Exercise 1: Set up the general outline of my app.
- Exercises 2 and 3: JavaScript Basics Part 1 & 2
- Exercises 4 and 5: JavaScript Functions Part 1 & 2
- Exercise 6: DOM Interaction
- Exercise 7: APIs, Ajax & Asynchronous Behavior
- Exercise 8: Complex UI Elements with JavaScript
- Exercise 9: Introduction to jQuery
- Exercise 10: Bootstrap & UI Libraries
- Exercise 11: Performance & Debugging
## Optional: Advanced Deliverables

In addition to the required features, I can explore more advanced topics and add additional features to my app as desired. Some optional topics include touch interactions, loading indicators, and enhancing the app's aesthetics and functionality.

Let's start building my Pokédex JavaScript app and have fun learning along the way!
