# Pokédex JavaScript App

This project is a small web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web application. As part of this project, I aim to learn about programming by completing a project using JavaScript and related technologies. Since I haven’t yet learned how to build my own API, I'll be relying on an external data source for this project.

## Features and Requirements

### User Goals
I should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand. In this case, I'll build a simple Pokédex app to display a list of Pokémon.
